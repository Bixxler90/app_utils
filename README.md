An application plugin that offers utility functions designed for use on both the Android and iOS platforms.
 
## Installation

###   Android

In the Android context, you have the option to either declare the QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES permission (providing a wider scope of visibility for app packages) or specify packages within the <queries> tag in your AndroidManifest.xml file.

  Note: Using QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES permission could result in the potential rejection of your app on the Play Store if your app lacks essential core functionalities that necessitate a broader package visibility.
        For instance, applications like antivirus software that require broader visibility to scan all apps on the device. If your app does not inherently demand QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES permission as a core functionality,
        it is recommended to explore the option of using the **queries** tag instead.
  

     <!-- Only for core functionality apps like antivirus, device security, etc. -->
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES"/> 

      OR 

    <!-- For all common use cases -->
    <queries> 
     <package android:name="com.whatsapp.businessapp"/> 
     <package android:name="in.techbyvishesh.myapp"/> 
     </queries>


###  iOS

In Ios, for opening the target app from your app, you need to provide the URL scheme of the target app.

To know more about URLScheme in iOS, please visit below link. <br> https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/defining-a-custom-url-scheme-for-your-app

In your deployment target is greater than or equal to 9 then also need to update another app information in your Info.plist.

    <key>LSApplicationQueriesSchemes</key>
    <array>
    <string>whatsapp</string> // url scheme
    </array>
